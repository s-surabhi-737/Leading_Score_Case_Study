Lead Scoring Case Study 
üìå Project Problem Statement
X Education, an online course provider for industry professionals, aims to improve its lead conversion rate. Currently, only 30% of leads convert. 

üéØ Objectives
The goal is to develop a lead scoring model using logistic regression to assign scores based on the likelihood of conversion, with a target conversion rate of 80%.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
1.Programming Language: Python
2.Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
3.Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Logistic Regression
4.Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Key Findings & Business Insights
1.Prioritize leads with high lead scores.
2.Focus on leads engaging through 'SMS Sent' as their conversion rate is high.
3.Improve conversion efforts on 'API' and 'Landing Page Submission' leads.
4.Increase efforts to attract 'Working Professionals,' as they convert the most.

Model Outcomes
1.This classification model can be deployed to help the business accurately predict outcomes (e.g., lead conversion) with 96% accuracy.
2.The high precision and recall for both classes ensure that the model minimizes both false positives (incorrectly predicting a lead would convert) and false negatives (missing out on actual lead conversions).
3.A high ROC AUC score indicates the model can strongly differentiate between both classes, further enhancing its performance.
